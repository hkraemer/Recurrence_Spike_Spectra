abstract = "Numerical results discussed in this paper suggest that a function which detects nonlinear correlations in time series usually indicates shorter correlation times than the linear autocorrelation function which is often used for this purpose. The nonlinear correlation function can also detect changes in the data which cannot be distinguished by the linear counterpart. This affects a number of approaches for the selection of the delay time used in the reconstruction of nonlinear dynamics from a single time series based on time delay coordinates."

This work proposes two formulas to estimate the KS entropy and a lower bound of it, a sort of Shannon's entropy per unit of time, from the recurrence times of chaotic systems. One formula provides the KS entropy and is more theoretically oriented since one has to measure also the low probable very long returns. The other provides a lower bound for the KS entropy and is more experimentally oriented since one has to measure only the high probable short returns. These formulas are a consequence of the fact that the series of returns do contain the same information of the trajectory that generated it. That suggests that recurrence times might be valuable when making models of complex systems.},

abstract = "Coupled biological and chemical systems, neural networks, social interacting species, the Internet and the World Wide Web, are only a few examples of systems composed by a large number of highly interconnected dynamical units. The first approach to capture the global properties of such systems is to model them as graphs whose nodes represent the dynamical units, and whose links stand for the interactions between them. On the one hand, scientists have to cope with structural issues, such as characterizing the topology of a complex wiring architecture, revealing the unifying principles that are at the basis of real networks, and developing models to mimic the growth of a network and reproduce its structural properties. On the other hand, many relevant questions arise when studying complex networks’ dynamics, such as learning how a large ensemble of dynamical systems that interact through a complex wiring topology can behave collectively. We review the major concepts and results recently achieved in the study of the structure and dynamics of complex networks, and summarize the relevant applications of these ideas in many different disciplines, ranging from nonlinear science to biology, from statistical mechanics to medicine and engineering."

We present a comparison of four methods, which simultaneously estimate the two embedding parameters (delay time τ and sufficiently large embedding dimension dimE) for Takens' delay time coordinates. Recently we introduced a global geometrical measure, the fill-factor, and a local dynamical measure, the averaged integral local deformation. We will discuss these methods briefly and compare them to the topological wavering-product. In addition a simple algorithm is presented, which observes the spreading of trajectories at the transition from dimE to dimE + 1 and gives the opportunity to estimate the correlation entropy K2. We applied these algorithms to experimental data series measured from a rotational Taylor-Couette experiment and verified the quality of the obtained embedding parameters by the estimation of correlation dimensions for different reconstructed attractors."

abstract = "Multivariate time series data are common in experimental and industrial systems. If the generating system has nonlinear dynamics, we may be able to construct a model that reproduces the dynamics and can be used for control and other purposes. In principle, multivariate time series are not necessary for recovering dynamics: according to the embedding theorem, only one time series should be needed. However, for real data, there may be large gains in using all of the measurements. In this paper we examine the issues of how to use multiple data streams most effectively for modeling and prediction. For example, perhaps the data are redundant in that only a subset of the data streams is useful. And how should we embed the data, if indeed embedding is required at all? We show how these questions can be answered, and describe some numerical experiments which show that using multivariate time series can significantly improve predictability. We also demonstrate a somewhat surprising synchronization between different reconstructions."

abstract = "Takens' theorem demonstrates that in the absence of noise a multidimensional state space can be reconstructed from a scalar time series. This theorem gives little guidance, however, about practical considerations for reconstructing a good state space. We extend Takens' treatment, applying statistical methods to incorporate the effects of observational noise and estimation error. We define the distortion matrix, which is proportional to the conditional covariance of a state, given a series of noisy measurements, and the noise amplification, which is proportional to root-square time series prediction errors with an ideal model. We derive explicit formulae for these quantities, and we prove that in the low noise limit minimizing the distortion is equivalent to minimizing the noise amplification. We identify several different scaling regimes for distortion and noise amplification, and derive asymptotic scaling laws. When the dimension and Lyapunov exponents are sufficiently large these scaling laws show that, no matter how the state space is reconstructed, there is an explosion in the noise amplification - from a practical point of view determinism is lost, and the time series is effectively a random process. In the low noise, large data limit we show that the technique of local singular value decomposition is an optimal coordinate transformation, in the sense that it achieves the minimum distortion in a state space of the lowest possible dimension. However, in numerical experiments we find that estimation error complicates this issue. For local approximation methods, we analyze the effect of reconstruction on estimation error, derive a scaling law, and suggest an algorithm for reducing estimation errors."

@article{deyle2011,
Abstract = {Takens' theorem (1981) shows how lagged variables of a single time series can be used as proxy variables to reconstruct an attractor for an underlying dynamic process. State space reconstruction (SSR) from single time series has been a powerful approach for the analysis of the complex, non-linear systems that appear ubiquitous in the natural and human world. The main shortcoming of these methods is the phenomenological nature of attractor reconstructions. Moreover, applied studies show that these single time series reconstructions can often be improved ad hoc by including multiple dynamically coupled time series in the reconstructions, to provide a more mechanistic model. Here we provide three analytical proofs that add to the growing literature to generalize Takens' work and that demonstrate how multiple time series can be used in attractor reconstructions. These expanded results (Takens' theorem is a special case) apply to a wide variety of natural systems having parallel time series observations for variables believed to be related to the same dynamic manifold. The potential information leverage provided by multiple embeddings created from different combinations of variables (and their lags) can pave the way for new applied techniques to exploit the time-limited, but parallel observations of natural systems, such as coupled ecological systems, geophysical systems, and financial systems. This paper aims to justify and help open this potential growth area for SSR applications in the natural sciences.},

@article{donner2011,
	Abstract = {Recently, several complex network approaches to time series analysis have been developedand applied to study a wide range of model systems as well as real-world data, e.g.,geophysical or financial time series. Among these techniques, recurrence-based conceptsand prominently ε-recurrence networks, most faithfully represent thegeometrical fine structure of the attractors underlying chaotic (and less interestinglynon-chaotic) time series. In this paper we demonstrate that the well known graphtheoretical properties local clustering coefficient and global (network) transitivity canmeaningfully be exploited to define two new local and two new global measures of dimensionin phase space: local upper and lower clustering dimension as well as global upper andlower transitivity dimension. Rigorous analytical as well as numerical results forself-similar sets and simple chaotic model systems suggest that these measures arewell-behaved in most non-pathological situations and that they can be estimated reasonablywell using ε-recurrence networks constructed from relatively short timeseries. Moreover, we study the relationship between clustering and transitivity dimensionson the one hand, and traditional measures like pointwise dimension or local Lyapunovdimension on the other hand. We also provide further evidence that the local clusteringcoefficients, or equivalently the local clustering dimensions, are useful for identifyingunstable periodic orbits and other dynamically invariant objects from time series. Ourresults demonstrate that ε-recurrence networks exhibit an important linkbetween dynamical systems and graph theory.},

abstract = "Constructing models from time series with nontrivial dynamics involves the problem of how to choose the best model from within a class of models, or to choose between competing classes. This paper discusses a method of building nonlinear models of possibly chaotic systems from data, while maintaining good robustness against noise. The models that are built are close to the simplest possible according to a description length criterion. The method will deliver a linear model if that has shorter description length than a nonlinear model. We show how our models can be used for prediction, smoothing and interpolation in the usual way. We also show how to apply the results to identification of chaos by detecting the presence of homoclinic orbits directly from time series."

    abstract = {{<b>Background</b><br>Voice disorders affect patients profoundly, and acoustic tools can potentially measure voice function objectively. Disordered sustained vowels exhibit wide-ranging phenomena, from nearly periodic to highly complex, aperiodic vibrations, and increased "breathiness". Modelling and surrogate data studies have shown significant nonlinear and non-Gaussian random properties in these sounds. Nonetheless, existing tools are limited to analysing voices displaying near periodicity, and do not account for this inherent biophysical nonlinearity and non-Gaussian randomness, often using linear signal processing methods insensitive to these properties. They do not directly measure the two main biophysical symptoms of disorder: complex nonlinear aperiodicity, and turbulent, aeroacoustic, non-Gaussian randomness. Often these tools cannot be applied to more severe disordered voices, limiting their clinical usefulness.<br><br><b>Methods</b><br>This paper introduces two new tools to speech analysis: recurrence and fractal scaling, which overcome the range limitations of existing tools by addressing directly these two symptoms of disorder, together reproducing a "hoarseness" diagram. A simple bootstrapped classifier then uses these two features to distinguish normal from disordered voices.<br><br><b>Results</b><br>On a large database of subjects with a wide variety of voice disorders, these new techniques can distinguish normal from disordered cases, using quadratic discriminant analysis, to overall correct classification performance of 91.8 &plusmn; 2.0%. The true positive classification performance is 95.4 &plusmn; 3.2%, and the true negative performance is 91.5 &plusmn; 2.3% (95% confidence). This is shown to outperform all combinations of the most popular classical tools.<br><br><b>Conclusion</b><br><p>Given the very large number of arbitrary parameters and computational complexity of existing techniques, these new techniques are far simpler and yet achieve clinically useful classification performance using only a basic classification technique. They do so by exploiting the inherent nonlinearity and turbulent randomness in disordered voice signals. They are widely applicable to the whole range of disordered voice phenomena by design. These new measures could therefore be used for a variety of practical clinical purposes.}},

To mimic an experimental setting, noise was superimposed onto a deterministic time series. Data smoothing was then used to successfully recover the derivative coordinates; however, the appropriate level of data smoothing must be determined. To investigate the level of smoothing, an information theoretic is applied to show a loss of information occurs for increased levels of noise; conversely, we have shown data smoothing can recover information by removing noise. An approximate criterion is then developed to balance the notion of information recovery through data smoothing with the observation that nearly negligible information changes occur for a sufficiently smoothed time series."

While several linear approaches are often insufficient to describe such processes, there are several nonlinear methods that, however, require rather long time observations. To overcome these difficulties, we propose measures of complexity based on vertical structures in recurrence plots and apply them to the logistic map as well as to heart-rate-variability data. For the logistic map these measures enable us not only to detect transitions between chaotic and periodic states, but also to identify laminar states, i.e., chaos-chaos transitions. The traditional recurrence quantification analysis fails to detect the latter transitions. Applying our measures to the heart-rate-variability data, we are able to detect and quantify the laminar phases before a life-threatening cardiac arrhythmia occurs thereby facilitating a prediction of such an event. Our findings could be of importance for the therapy of malignant cardiac arrhythmias.},

Unlike previous suggestions, this guideline is based on first principles and simple quantities. We argue that discrete Legendre polynomials provide a quick and not-so-dirty substitute for principal component analysis, and that they are a good practical method for state space reconstruction."

The theorem applies when the dynamical system is sampled uniformly in time. There has, however, been increasing interest in situations where observations on the system are not uniform in time, and in particular where they consist of a series of inter-event (‘interspike’) intervals. Sauer has provided an embedding theorem for the case where these intervals are generated by an integrate-and-fire mechanism. Here we prove several embedding theorems pertaining to non-uniform sampling. We consider two situations: in the first, the observations consist of the values of some function on the state space of the system, with the times between successive observations being given by another function—the sampling interval function; in the second, the sampling times are generated in the same way, but now the observations consist only of the intersample intervals. We prove embedding theorems both when the sampling interval function is allowed to be fairly general, and when it corresponds to integrate-and-fire sampling. We point out that non-uniform sampling might lead to better reconstructions than uniform sampling, for certain kinds of time series.}

We show how to implement these procedures by combining embedding and modeling into a single procedure with a single optimization goal."

Using the singular values computed from a singular value decomposition (SVD) of the embedded flow, we compute a quantity which we term the singular value fraction (SVF) as a function of the chosen lag time Δ, and denoted as fsv (Δ). For a given value of k, it gives the fractional power in the first k singular values. We seek to choose Δ so that folding of the attractor is minimised, but the attractor volume is maximised, and we thus choose Δ to be at the first minimum of fsv. Equivalently we use a window of size Δw, where Δw is apprximately the first major maximum of fsv. It is shown that this method compares favourably with some other extant methods."

Often, τd is estimated using the autocorrelation function; however, this does not treat the nonlinearity appropriately, and it may yield an incorrect value for τd. On the other hand, the correct value of τd can be found from the mutual information, but this process is rather cumbersome computationally. Here, we suggest a simpler method for estimating τd using the correlation integral. We call this the C–C method, and we test it on several nonlinear time series, obtaining estimates of τd in agreement with those obtained using the mutual information. Furthermore, some researchers have suggested that one should not choose a fixed delay time τd, independent of the embedding dimension m, but, rather, one should choose an appropriate value for the delay time window τw=(m−1)τ, which is the total time spanned by the components of each embedded point. Unfortunately, τw cannot be estimated using the autocorrelation function or the mutual information, and no standard procedure for estimating τw has emerged. However, we show that the C–C method can also be used to estimate τw. Basically τw is the optimal time for independence of the data, while τd is the first locally optimal time. As tests, we apply the C–C method to the Lorenz system, a three-dimensional irrational torus, the Rossler system, and the Rabinovich–Fabrikant system. We also demonstrate the robustness of this method to the presence of noise."

abstract = "Recurrence Quantification Analysis (RQA) defines a number of quantifiers, which base upon diagonal line structures in the recurrence plot (RP). Due to the finite size of an RP, these lines can be cut by the borders of the RP and, thus, bias the length distribution of diagonal lines and, consequently, the line based RQA measures. In this letter we investigate the impact of the mentioned border effects and of the thickening of diagonal lines in an RP (caused by tangential motion) on the estimation of the diagonal line length distribution, quantified by its entropy. Although a relation to the Lyapunov spectrum is theoretically expected, the mentioned entropy yields contradictory results in many studies. Here we summarize correction schemes for both, the border effects and the tangential motion and systematically compare them to methods from the literature. We show that these corrections lead to the expected behavior of the diagonal line length entropy, in particular meaning zero values in case of a regular motion and positive values for chaotic motion. Moreover, we test these methods under noisy conditions, in order to supply practical tools for applied statistical research."

However, under certain conditions,reconstruction is possible even in a space of smaller dimension. Thistopic is very important because the size of the reconstruction spacerelates to the effectiveness of the whole subsequent analysis. Inthis paper, the false nearest neighbour (FNN) methods are revisitedto estimate the optimum embedding parameters and the most appropriateobservables for state space reconstruction. A modification of thefalse nearest neighbour method is introduced. The findings contribute to evidence that the length of the embeddingtime window (TW) is more important than the reconstruction delay timeand the embedding dimension (ED) separately. Moreover, if severaltime series of the same system are observed, the choice of the onethat is used for the reconstruction could also be critical. The resultsare demonstrated on two chaotic benchmark systems.},

Many techniques have been suggested to estimate the parameters of MOD, i.e. the time delay τ and the embedding dimension m. We discuss the applicability of these techniques with a critical view as to their validity, and point out the necessity of determining the overall time window length, τW, for successful embedding. Emphasis is put on the relation between τW and the dynamics of the underlying chaotic system, and we suggest to set τW ≥ τp, the mean orbital period; τp is approximated from the oscillations of the time series. The procedure is assessed using the correlation dimension for both synthetic and real data. For clean synthetic data, values of τW larger than τp always give good results given enough data and thus τp can be considered as a lower limit (τW ≥ τp). For noisy synthetic data and real data, an upper limit is reached for τW which approaches τp for increasing noise amplitude."

Here we derive analytical expressions which relate the values of key statistics, notably determinism and entropy of line length distribution, to the correlation sum as a function of embedding dimension. These expressions are obtained by deriving the transformation which generates an embedded recurrence plot from an unembedded plot. A single unembedded recurrence plot thus provides the statistics of all possible embedded recurrence plots. If the correlation sum scales exponentially with embedding dimension, we show that these statistics are determined entirely by the exponent of the exponential. This explains the results of Iwanski and Bradley [J.S. Iwanski, E. Bradley, Recurrence plots of experimental data: to embed or not to embed? Chaos 8 (1998) 861-871] who found that certain recurrence plot statistics are apparently invariant to embedding dimension for certain low-dimensional systems. We also examine the relationship between the mutual information content of two timeseries and the common recurrent structure seen in their recurrence plots. This allows time-localized contributions to mutual information to be visualized. This technique is demonstrated using geomagnetic index data; we show that the AU and AL geomagnetic indices share half their information, and find the timescale on which mutual features appear.},

    abstract = {Recurrence is a fundamental property of dynamical systems, which can be exploited to characterise the system's behaviour in phase space. A powerful tool for their visualisation and analysis called recurrence plot was introduced in the late 1980's. This report is a comprehensive overview covering recurrence based methods and their applications with an emphasis on recent developments. After a brief outline of the theory of recurrences, the basic idea of the recurrence plot with its variations is presented. This includes the quantification of recurrence plots, like the recurrence quantification analysis, which is highly effective to detect, e. g., transitions in the dynamics of systems from time series. A main point is how to link recurrences to dynamical invariants and unstable periodic orbits. This and further evidence suggest that recurrences contain all relevant information about a system's behaviour. As the respective phase spaces of two systems change due to coupling, recurrence plots allow studying and quantifying their interaction. This fact also provides us with a sensitive tool for the study of synchronisation of complex systems. In the last part of the report several applications of recurrence plots in economy, physiology, neuroscience, earth sciences, astrophysics and engineering are shown. The aim of this work is to provide the readers with the know how for the application of recurrence plot based methods in their own field of research. We therefore detail the analysis of data and indicate possible difficulties and pitfalls.},

We show that reconstruction expansion is related to the concept of reconstruction signal strength and that increased expansion corresponds to diminished effects of measurement error. Thus, reconstruction expansion represents a simple, geometrical framework for choosing τ. Furthermore, we describe the role of dynamical error in attractor expansion and argue that algorithms for determining τ should be considered as attempts at estimating an upper bound to the optimal delay."

IfA is a chaotic attractor of a typical dynamical system, then the same is true for almost everydelay-coordinate map fromRktoRn. These results are extended in two other directions. Similar results are proved in the more general case of reconstructions which use moving averages of delay coordinates.

Many competing criteria to select these parameters exist, and all are heuristic. Within the context of modelling the evolution operator of the underlying dynamical system, we show that one only need be concerned with the product deτ. We introduce an information theoretic criterion for the optimal selection of the embedding window dw=deτ. For infinitely long time series, this method is equivalent to selecting the embedding lag that minimises the nonlinear model prediction error. For short and noisy time series, we find that the results of this new algorithm are data-dependent and are superior to estimation of embedding parameters with the standard techniques."

    abstract = { Abstract In the non-linear analysis of scalar time series the common practice is to reconstruct the state space using time-delay embedding. When there are more than one observed quantities, one can reconstruct the state space using a time-delay embedding scheme specifying embedding parameters for each quantity. In this study we investigate the state space reconstruction from multiple time series derived from continuous systems and propose a method for building the embedding vector progressively using information measure criteria. The proposed method is compared to other methods with simulations on known chaotic systems, such as individual and coupled Lorenz and Rössler systems. Our analysis showed that multivariate attractor reconstruction preserves better the dynamics of a system and our proposed method gives a parsimonious alternative to the simple extension of the univariate case. }

System outputs usually exhibit wide varieties of behaviors due to dynamical interactions between system components, external noise perturbations, and physiological state changes. Complicated interactions occur at a variety of hierarchial levels and involve a number of interacting variables, many of which are unavailable for experimental measurement. In this paper we illustrate how recurrence plots can take single physiological measurements, project them into multidimensional space by embedding procedures, and identify time correlations (recurrences) that are not apparent in the one-dimensional time series. We extend the original description of recurrence plots by computing an array of specific recurrence variables that quantify the deterministic structure and complexity of the plot. We then demonstrate how physiological states can be assessed by making repeated recurrence plot calculations within a window sliding down any physiological dynamic. Unlike other predominant time series techniques, recurrence plot analyses are not limited by data stationarity and size constraints. Pertinent physiological examples from respiratory and skeletal motor systems illustrate the utility of recurrence plots in the diagnosis of nonlinear systems. The methodology is fully applicable to any rhythmical system, whether it be mechanical, electrical, neural, hormonal, chemical, or even spacial.},

    abstract = {In the last decade, there has been a growing body of literature addressing the utilization of complex network methods for the characterization of dynamical systems based on time series. While both nonlinear time series analysis and complex network theory are widely considered to be established fields of complex systems sciences with strong links to nonlinear dynamics and statistical physics, the thorough combination of both approaches has become an active field of nonlinear time series analysis, which has allowed addressing fundamental questions regarding the structural organization of nonlinear dynamics as well as the successful treatment of a variety of applications from a broad range of disciplines. In this report, we provide an in-depth review of existing approaches of time series networks, covering their methodological foundations, interpretation and practical considerations with an emphasis on recent developments. After a brief outline of the state-of-the-art of nonlinear time series analysis and the theory of complex networks, we focus on three main network approaches, namely, phase space based recurrence networks, visibility graphs and Markov chain based transition networks, all of which have made their way from abstract concepts to widely used methodologies. These three concepts, as well as several variants thereof will be discussed in great detail regarding their specific properties, potentials and limitations. More importantly, we emphasize which fundamental new insights complex network approaches bring into the field of nonlinear time series analysis. In addition, we summarize examples from the wide range of recent applications of these methods, covering rather diverse fields like climatology, fluid dynamics, neurophysiology, engineering and economics, and demonstrating the great potentials of time series networks for tackling real-world contemporary scientific problems. The overall aim of this report is to provide the readers with the knowledge how the complex network approaches can be applied to their own field of real-world time series analysis.},

The exponent v is closely related to the fractal dimension and the information dimension, but its computation is considerably easier. Its usefulness in characterizing experimental data which stem from very high dimensional systems is stressed. Algorithms for extracting v from the time series of a single variable are proposed. The relations between the various measures of strange attractors and between them and the Lyapunov exponents are discussed. It is shown that the conjecture of Kaplan and Yorke for the dimension gives an upper bound for v. Various examples of finite and infinite dimensional systems are treated, both numerically and analytically.}

We prove that lim q→0 Dq = fractal dimension (D), limq→1Dq = information dimension (σ) and Dq=2 = correlation exponent (v). Dq with other integer q's correspond to exponents associated with ternary, quaternary and higher correlation functions. We prove that generally Dq > Dq for any q′ > q. For homogeneous fractals Dq = Dq. A particularly interesting dimension is Dq=∞. For two examples (Feigenbaum attractor, generalized baker's transformation) we calculate the generalized dimensions and find that D∞ is a non-trivial number. All the other generalized dimensions are bounded between the fractal dimension and D∞.}

It is based on the observation that the true Lyapunov exponents change their signs upon time reversal whereas the spurious exponents do not. Furthermore by comparison of the spectra of the original data and the reversed time series suitable values for the free parameters of the algorithm used for computing the Lyapunov exponents (e.g., the number of nearest neighbors) are determined. As an example for this general approach an algorithm using local nonlinear approximations of the flow map in embedding space by radial basis functions is presented. For noisy data a regularization method is applied in order to get smooth approximating functions. Numerical examples based on data from the Hénon map, a four-dimensional analog of the Hénon map, a quasiperiodic time series, the Lorenz model, and Duffing’s equation are given.}

By exploiting properties of the signal which mimic the deterministic structure created by non-linear coherent effects of a turbulent fluid and by resolving the strong inherent non-stationarity as a sequence of different dynamical regimes, short time predictions of future wind velocities can be performed. Although on average no reduction of the prediction error can be achieved using a non-linear model instead of a linear stochastic one, intermittent gusts can be predicted with significantly higher accuracy. An asymmetry in the predictability is observed, which suggests that an increase of the velocity is rather deterministic, whereas the subsequent decrease is dominated by a stochastic behaviour.}

In contrast to the established methods, the minimization of an appropriate cost function determines the embedding dimension without using a threshold parameter. Moreover, the method is capable of detecting stochastic time series and, thus, can handle noise contaminated input without adjusting parameters. The superiority of the proposed method is shown on some paradigmatic models and experimental data from chaotic chemical oscillators.}

abstract = {Understanding dynamic constraints and balances in nature has facilitated rapid development of knowledge and enabled technology, including aircraft, combustion engines, satellites, and electrical power. This work develops a novel framework to discover governing equations underlying a dynamical system simply from data measurements, leveraging advances in sparsity techniques and machine learning. The resulting models are parsimonious, balancing model complexity with descriptive ability while avoiding overfitting. There are many critical data-driven problems, such as understanding cognition from neural recordings, inferring climate patterns, determining stability of financial markets, predicting and suppressing the spread of disease, and controlling turbulence for greener transportation and energy. With abundant data and elusive laws, data-driven discovery of dynamics will continue to play an important role in these efforts. Extracting governing equations from data is a central challenge in many diverse areas of science and engineering. Data are abundant whereas models often remain elusive, as in climate science, neuroscience, ecology, finance, and epidemiology, to name only a few examples. In this work, we combine sparsity-promoting techniques and machine learning with nonlinear dynamical systems to discover governing equations from noisy measurement data. The only assumption about the structure of the model is that there are only a few important terms that govern the dynamics, so that the equations are sparse in the space of possible functions; this assumption holds for many physical systems in an appropriate basis. In particular, we use sparse regression to determine the fewest terms in the dynamic governing equations required to accurately represent the data. This results in parsimonious models that balance accuracy with model complexity to avoid overfitting. We demonstrate the algorithm on a wide range of problems, from simple canonical systems, including linear and nonlinear oscillators and the chaotic Lorenz system, to the fluid vortex shedding behind an obstacle. The fluid example illustrates the ability of this method to discover the underlying dynamics of a system that took experts in the community nearly 30 years to resolve. We also show that this method generalizes to parameterized systems and systems that are time-varying or have external forcing.}

abstract = {SUMMARY We propose a new method for estimation in linear models. The ‘lasso’ minimizes the residual sum of squares subject to the sum of the absolute value of the coefficients being less than a constant. Because of the nature of this constraint it tends to produce some coefficients that are exactly 0 and hence gives interpretable models. Our simulation studies suggest that the lasso enjoys some of the favourable properties of both subset selection and ridge regression. It produces interpretable models like subset selection and exhibits the stability of ridge regression. There is also an interesting relationship with recent work in adaptive function estimation by Donoho and Johnstone. The lasso idea is quite general and can be applied in a variety of statistical models: extensions to generalized regression models and tree-based models are briefly described.},

abstract = {Before we apply nonlinear techniques, e.g. those inspired by chaos theory, to dynamical phenomena occurring in nature, it is necessary to first ask if the use of such advanced techniques is justified by the data. While many processes in nature seem very unlikely a priori to be linear, the possible nonlinear nature might not be evident in specific aspects of their dynamics. The method of surrogate data has become a very popular tool to address such a question. However, while it was meant to provide a statistically rigorous, foolproof framework, some limitations and caveats have shown up in its practical use. In this paper, recent efforts to understand the caveats, avoid the pitfalls, and to overcome some of the limitations, are reviewed and augmented by new material. In particular, we will discuss specific as well as more general approaches to constrained randomisation, providing a full range of examples. New algorithms will be introduced for unevenly sampled and multivariate data and for surrogate spike trains. The main limitation, which lies in the interpretability of the test results, will be illustrated through instructive case studies. We will also discuss some implementational aspects of the realisation of these methods in the TISEAN software package.}

@article{Kraemer2022,
	abstract = {A novel idea for an optimal time delay state space reconstruction from uni- and multivariate time series is presented. The entire embedding process is considered as a game, in which each move corresponds to an embedding cycle and is subject to an evaluation through an objective function. This way the embedding procedure can be modeled as a tree, in which each leaf holds a specific value of the objective function. By using a Monte Carlo ansatz, the proposed algorithm populates the tree with many leafs by computing different possible embedding paths and the final embedding is chosen as that particular path, which ends at the leaf with the lowest achieved value of the objective function. The method aims to prevent getting stuck in a local minimum of the objective function and can be used in a modular way, enabling practitioners to choose a statistic for possible delays in each embedding cycle as well as a suitable objective function themselves. The proposed method guarantees the optimization of the chosen objective function over the parameter space of the delay embedding as long as the tree is sampled sufficiently. As a proof of concept, we demonstrate the superiority of the proposed method over the classical time delay embedding methods using a variety of application examples. We compare recurrence plot-based statistics inferred from reconstructions of a Lorenz-96 system and highlight an improved forecast accuracy for map-like model data as well as for palaeoclimate isotope time series. Finally, we utilize state space reconstruction for the detection of causality and its strength between observables of a gas turbine type thermoacoustic combustor.},
