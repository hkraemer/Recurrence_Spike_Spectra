*block-on-friction*: two bodies in frictional contact. High-quality experimental data from University of Rome La Sapienza (Prof. F. Massi). Various measurements available.

+ many complicated transitions and quite divers dynamics (limit cycles, tori, stick-slip cycles)

- There are some states (motion of both bodies, normal and tangential force) - however, this is clearly not the full state space representation of the natural system (theoretically having infinite number of states). 

____________________________________________
*brake system sounds*: microphone measurements of brake squeal sound (real data from Audi braking system). 

+ real-world complex dynamics. Different harmonics and multi-frequent vibrations

- microphone measurement: univariate time series at limited sampling rate (51200Hz)


____________________________________________
*hyperchaotic simulation*: numerical data from analytical frictional oscillator model.

+ all states (8) available
+ hyper-chaotic vibrations coexisting to periodic dynamics

- no real measurmeent
