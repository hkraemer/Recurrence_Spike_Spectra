Description of the measurement data provided by F. Massi and collaborators

Measurement channels:
- 1st col: Time
- 2nd col: Point A: fixed sample velocity
- 3rd col: Point B: test setup acceleration
- 4th col: Tangential force
- 5th col: Normal force


Friction coefficient:
- 1st col: Time
- 2nd col: friction coefficient

Velocity profile: Deceleration frmo 20 to 0 mm/s
Sampling frequency: 100kHz

Experimental modal analysis (transfer accelerance between A and B):
- available up to 8kHz, proper coherence up to 6.5kHz
- several modes visible, but strongly damped
